# README: Scene Editor - Client

Welcome to the Scene Editor Client repository!

## Dev Setup

#### npm:
First ensure that you have the latest version of `Node.js` and `npm`(Node Package Manager) installed globally on your machine. Downloading [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) will automatically install npm as well. Verify completion by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.

#### Installing Dependencies:
Navigate into the client folder beforehand with `cd client`. This project uses `npm` as a package manager and you can download the necessary dependencies by running `npm i` or `npm install` in the client folder.

#### Running the App:
After all dependencies have been installed, run `npm start` in a separate terminal to automatically launch the application in your browser. It can also be reached through [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081). The page will automatically reload if you make edits.

## More

#### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
